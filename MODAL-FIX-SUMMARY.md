# Activity Modal Fix Summary

## Problem
The activity modal was only working when triggered from the sidebar (`addActivityBtn`) but not from the activities page (`addManualActivity` button).

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `setupEventListeners()` function in `src/renderer/renderer.js`. The function was only setting up event listeners for the sidebar button (`addActivityBtn`) but not for the activities page button (`addManualActivity`).

When components are loaded dynamically using the modular component system, the event listeners need to be re-initialized for elements within those components. The `reinitializeEventListeners()` function was already in place and being called when components are loaded, but it was missing the event listener for the activities page button.

## Solution
Updated the `setupEventListeners()` function to include event listeners for both buttons:

```javascript
// Quick Actions
document.getElementById('addActivityBtn')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
    showAddActivityModal();
});

// Add Activity button in activities page
document.getElementById('addManualActivity')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
    showAddActivityModal();
});
```

## Files Modified
1. **`src/renderer/renderer.js`** - Added event listener for `addManualActivity` button
2. **`src/renderer/components/index.html`** - Fixed linter errors:
   - Added `aria-label` to console toggle button
   - Added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` for Safari compatibility

## How It Works
1. When the app initializes, `setupEventListeners()` sets up listeners for both buttons
2. When components are loaded dynamically, `reinitializeEventListeners()` is called
3. This re-runs `setupEventListeners()`, ensuring both buttons have event listeners
4. Both buttons now call `showAddActivityModal()` which uses the modal manager to display the activity form

## Testing
Created `test-modal-fix.html` to verify the fix works correctly for both buttons.

## Result
The activity modal now works consistently from both:
- ✅ Sidebar "Add Activity" button (`addActivityBtn`)
- ✅ Activities page "Add Activity" button (`addManualActivity`)
